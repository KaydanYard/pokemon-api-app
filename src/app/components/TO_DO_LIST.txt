Bootstrap is causing issues with Angular Material.  It needs to be removed.

TO DO list
----------

✅ 1. Take out the carousel and the unordered list styles that rely on Bootstrap
✅ 2. Replace them with their Angular Material counterparts (carousel replaced with Tabs)
❌ 3. Work on adding a favorites function to pokefind and add a new component called favorites
(must add authentication to implement the favorites function)

When Authentication is added use this repo:
