TO DO list
--------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. Take out the carousel and the unordered list styles that rely on Bootstrap
✅ 2. Replace them with their Angular Material counterparts (carousel replaced with Tabs)
✅ 3. Work on adding a favorites function to pokefind and add a new component called favorites
(must add authentication to implement the favorites function)

When Authentication is added use this repo: 
  https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app/blob/master/src/app/shared/buttons/favorite-button.component.ts 

to add the favorite button

✅ 4. Create a sign up page in the components folder
✅ 5. Link Firebase Authentication to the sign up page
  ✅ 5.1. Create mock profiles on Firebase and use them to log in
  ✅ 5.2. Add sign up functionality to the sign up page to create new profiles
  ✅ 5.3. Reinstate Pokefind and the Home Page through routing
✅ 6. Add login functionality to the home page
  ✅ 6.1. Make it easier to navigate the app.
  📍 6.2. Fix bug #3

✅ 7. Add a Paginator to the bottom of the Pokéfind page
📍 8. Add more content to the home component
❌ 9. Add Mega Evolution forms and other unique forms for pokémon


STYLING
--------------------------------------------------
✅ 0.5. Fix the following components using Bootstrap: ✅ Login, ✅ Sign Up, ✅ Forgot Password, ✅ Verify Email, ✅ Dashboard
✅ 1. Style the Nav Bar by using mat-buttons instead of regular links
  ✅ 1.1. Add spacing to the Nav Bar
❌ 2. Add more Styles to the home component
✅ 3. Center the login and sign up content
✅ 4. Update favicon


BUGS
--------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. The Nav Bar is adding the router link to the end of the current url.  
   This is causing it to have trouble navigating from the Sign Up page to the Pokéfind page.
   (Try clearing the old route then add the new route)

✅ 2. The title of the navbar was delayed and would display the incorrect title for the page.

❌ 3. To login you have to click the Log In button twice.  This is annoying.
