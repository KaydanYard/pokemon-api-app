BUGS
--------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. The Nav Bar is adding the router link to the end of the current url.  
   This is causing it to have trouble navigating from the Sign Up page to the Pokéfind page.
   (Try clearing the old route then add the new route)

✅ 2. The title of the navbar was delayed and would display the incorrect title for the page.

✅ 3. To login you have to click the Log In button twice.  This is annoying.

❌ 4. Not automatically routing user to their Dashboard page.

❌ 5. Fix the 404 page so it shows up.
