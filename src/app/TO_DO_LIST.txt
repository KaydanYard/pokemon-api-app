TO DO list
--------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. Take out the carousel and the unordered list styles that rely on Bootstrap
✅ 2. Replace them with their Angular Material counterparts (carousel replaced with Tabs)
❌ 3. Work on adding a favorites function to pokefind and add a new component called favorites
(must add authentication to implement the favorites function)

📍 4. Create a sign up page in the components folder
❌ 5. Link Firebase Authentication to the sign up page
❌ 6. Add login functionality to the home page

When Authentication is added use this repo: 
  https://github.com/gothinkster/angular-realworld-example-app/blob/master/src/app/shared/buttons/favorite-button.component.ts 

to add the favorite button

❌ 7. Add a Paginator to the bottom of the Pokéfind page

BUGS
--------------------------------------------------

✅ 1. The Nav Bar is adding the router link to the end of the current url.  
   This is causing it to have trouble navigating from the Sign Up page to the Pokéfind page.
   (Try clearing the old route then add the new route)
